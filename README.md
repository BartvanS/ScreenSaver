# ScreenSaver
Do you also feel nostalgic for the old school dvd images bouncing around serving as a screensaver? Then this application is for you!
Made in visual C++ without any dependencies, this application will bounce your mouse around, serving as a screensaver. It also creates a image that does the same.

## Usage
You can run the executable or run it from the terminal to have more options.
```
.\ScreenSaver.exe <-- enables both the mouse and the image
.\ScreenSaver.exe m <-- only displays the mouse pointer
.\ScreenSaver.exe i <-- only displays the image
```
## ToDo
- Code cleanup with more classes
- Multiple screen support
